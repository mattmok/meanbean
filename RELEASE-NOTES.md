## 3.0.0-M2

This is the first public release of meanbean v3. Maven groupId is now com.github.meanbeanlib and Java 8 is required.

Changes:
- Do not repeatedly warn about "dynamically created factory"
- Add BeanTesterBuilder for customizing BeanTester
- Add custom logger that delegates to slf4j or log4j2 if possible
- Add ServiceLoader mechanism for creating implementation instances of interfaces. Users may take advantage of that to
override default meanbean implementations.
- Add support for Array/Collection/Map of arbitrary element types and dimension. Previously the element type was always 
String and dimension was one. Support for more Collection/Map instance types.
- Add FactoryLookup interface for dynamically defining Factory at runtime. 
- Add ability to register Factory for a type hierarchy 
- Log warning if a property defines URL which requires .equals test that may be slow.
- Allow method references as property specifiers. (e.g. User::getName vs "Name")
